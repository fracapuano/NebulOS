# NebulOSS: Green-AI, for Real üåø
NebulOSS is an extension of the work presented in FreeREA, focusing on the real-world application of Green-AI. By adopting actual hardware-aware metrics, we are not just promising Green-AI but delivering it.

## Foreword üìù

### FreeREA
FreeREA is a custom cell-based evolution NAS algorithm that aims to maximize model accuracy while preserving size and computational constraints typical of tiny devices. It exploits an optimized combination of training-free metrics to rank architectures during the search, without the need for model training. [Read more about FreeREA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05135).

### HW-NAS-Bench
HW-NAS-Bench is the first public dataset for Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) research. It aims to democratize HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. It includes the measured/estimated hardware performance of networks on various hardware devices. [Read more about HW-NAS-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10584).

## Contributions üåü
NebulOSS takes a step further by adopting actual hardware-aware metrics, as presented in HW-NAS-Bench, to perform the automated design of Deep Neural Architectures. Unlike traditional methods that use proxies like the number of parameters or flops, NebulOSS focuses on the energy consumption of the models, thoroughly measured by hardware experts.

### Relevancy of Using Actual Hardware-Aware Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Provides more accurate and realistic evaluations.
- **Efficiency**: Enables optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.
- **Accessibility**: Democratizes HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts.
